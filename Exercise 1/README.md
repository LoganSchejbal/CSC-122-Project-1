Exercise #1:

Create a class called Employee that includes three private data members: a first name (type string), a last name (type string), and monthly salary (type int). The class will have a constructor that initializes the three data members. Include the set and get member functions for each data member. If the monthly salary is not positive, the set function will set it to 0. Also include a member function that returns the yearly salary (i.e. twelve times the monthly salary).
Write a test program that prompts the user to enter the first and last name of an employee as well as their monthly salary. The program will then output the yearly salary of the employee, give them a 10 percent raise, and output the new yearly salary.
Your code should be in multiple files with employee.h, empImp.cpp and empMain.cpp.  Be sure to include the run result in an output file.
